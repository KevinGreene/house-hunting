House Hunting

In House Hunting, you take on the role of a person / group of people looking to purchase a home. Your goal is to buy the home that results in you having the most money.

Players start with 300,000, and there are five base homes.

Each round, a new card is added to each house. Then, players can write a bid down. At the same time, all players reveal their bid.

If any player bid on a house, with no competitors, meeting the minimum, they get that house. If two players both bid on the same house, then they each make another private bid. The higher of the two gets the house.

In general, the game comes at the end, when players continue to reveal their decks, hoping they ended up buying the best house. If not, don't worry, I'm sure you'll be able to recoup your investment!
